## What This Project Is About

**SheetXray** is a backend service for a **RAG-style spreadsheet assistant** that works with uploaded Excel/Sheet-like documents.

The idea is:

- Users upload sheet files.
- Files are organized inside folders.
- The backend stores file metadata and access control per user.
- This foundation supports building a conversational layer where users can ask questions over their sheet data (RAG workflow).

> Current codebase already supports auth, folder management, and sheet upload/storage. Chat/query endpoints are not yet exposed in the current routes.

## Current Functionalities

- 👤 User registration with avatar upload (Cloudinary)
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication (access + refresh token)
- 🚪 Login/logout flow with secure cookies
- 🧯 Redis-backed login rate limiting
- 🗂️ Folder creation, listing, deletion
- 📄 Upload sheet files (multer + Cloudinary)
- 🧩 Map uploaded sheets to optional folders
- 🛡️ Protected routes via JWT middleware

---

## Base API Prefix

All routes are mounted under:

`/api/v1`

Example:

`POST /api/v1/users/login`

## Tech Stack

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Redis (ioredis)
- Multer for multipart uploads
- Cloudinary for file/media storage
- JWT + cookie-parser for auth

---

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start Redis (Docker compose file included):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Create `.env` in project root and configure at least:

```env
PORT=3000
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection
JWT_SECRET=your_access_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
```

4. Run server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Next Milestone (RAG Layer)

To complete the sheet-chat vision, next backend additions can include:

- Sheet parser + chunking pipeline
- Embedding generation and vector storage
- Retrieval endpoint for semantic context
- Chat/query endpoint with grounded responses from uploaded sheets
